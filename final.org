* Part One. Statistical Report

The purpose of this project is to understand a set of data and examine different values in the data set, and determine which of the values give us an accurate way to estimate the total value of all PCB congeners in a sample. The data we were given with the study was the Polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCBs, in a specimen and the type of congener that the total PCB compound is constructed of. In this study, we conducted correlation and multiple linear regression studies to examine the relationship in a set of data. 

We begin with analyzing the general statistics of the data. Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the PCB congener variables and Table 2 shows the relationship between each pair of variables by giving their correlations. The table showed that all of pairs have a positive correlation, meaning that any specimen with more than one PCB congener is expected to have other PCB congeners as well. 

We then examine a series of test with multiple regressions. Exercise 11.43-(b) gets us to practice the regression analysis of select PCBs. The squared multiple correlation coefficient is 0.989 and the residual standard error is 6.382. It means that approximately 98% of variation in the response variable PCB is explained by the explanatory variables in the regression equation. To reduce the standard error caused by the variance in the explanatory variables, we apply a logarithmic function to each and rerun the regression. As a result, the new regression indicates the squared multiple correlation coefficient is 0.9746 and the residual standard error is 0.135. Applying a logarithmic function to each variable efficiently reduces the standard error. Therefore, it is possible to make more accurate conclusions based on the model and to use it to better estimate the total amount of PCBs in a specimen using a subset of the total congeners in the specimen.

** 11.43 Predictiong the total amount of PCB
Use the four congeners PCB52, PCB118, PCB138, and PCB180 in a multiple regression to predict PCB. 
*** (a) Write the statistical model for this analysis. Include all assumptions.
The multiple linear regression model for the data with 69 observations:

y_i = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i1} + \beta_{2}x_{i2} + \beta_{3}x_{i3} + \beta_{4}x_{i4} + i /for/ /i = 1, 2, ... , 69/

We assume that the residuals are independent and are normally distributed. 
*** (b) Run the regression and summarize the results.
Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between PCB and four congeners. Running the multiple regression model in R with the four congeners produced the following:

***** We gathered the following from the results of the regression:
  + The multiple R^2 = 0.989
  + The residual SE = 6.249

**** Test 1 

H_{0} : \beta_0 = \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = \beta_4 = 0

H_1 : \beta_0 \neq 0 \vee \beta_1 \neq 0 \vee \beta_2 \neq 0 \vee \beta_3 \neq 0 \vee \beta_4 \neq 0

Since there is at least one \beta_n \neq 0, we reject H_0 

**** Test 2  

H_0 : \beta_j = 0, /j = 0, 1, 2, 3/

H_1 : \beta_j \neq 0

All regression coefficients are significantly different from 0 with the except of 0.94. We found that R^2 = 0.989, meaning that 98.9% of variation in PCB is from PCB52, PCB118, PCB138 and PCB180.

*** (c) Examine the residuals. Do they appear to be approximately Normal? When you plot them versus each of the explanatory variables, are any patterns evident? 
[[./graphs/image5.png]]
According to the graphs, the residuals shows two clear outliers and shows that the residuals are approximately normal. Rhere are no other patterns in the explanatory variables of note. 

** 11.44 Adjusting the analysis for potential outliers. 
The examination of the residuals in part (c) of the previous exercise suggests that there may be two outliers, one with a high residual and one with a low residual. 
*** (a) Because of safety issues, we are more concerned about underestimating PCB in a specimen than about overestimating. Give the specimen number for each of the two suspected outliers. Which one corresponds to an overestimate of PCB?
[[./graphs/image6.png]]
The specimen 50 and 65 are the two data points that are outliers. Specimen 65 corresponds to an overestimate of PCB due to its higher residual value. 

*** (b) Rerun the analysis with the two suspected outliers deleted, summarize these results, and compare them with those you obtained in the previous exercise.

The residual standard error has been decreased without the suspected outliers, from 6.382 to 4.555. R^2 has also increased from 0.989 to 0.994, meaning the predictions with this dataset become more accurate. 

** 11.45 More on predicting the total amount of PCB.
Run a regression to predict PCB using the variables PCB52, PCB118, and PCB138. Note that this is similar to the analysis that you did in Exercise 11.43, with the change that PCB 180 is not included as an explanatory variable.

We can get the following values from the results of the regression:
  + The squared multiple correlation coeffiicient R^2 = 0.973
  + The residual standard error SE = 9.942

*** (b) In this analysis, the regression coefficient for PCB118 is not statistically significant. Give the estimate of the coefficient and the associated /P/-value. 

+ Using a significance level \alpha = 0.05, Specimen PCB118 has a regression coefficient = 0.313 and /P/-value = 0.708
+ Significance Test: 0.708 > 0.05 (Reject when P > \alpha)
+ /P/-value is much larger than the significance level. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis. 

*** (c) Find the estimate of the coefficient for PCB118 and the associated /P/-value for the model analyzed the Ecercise 11.43.
+ Using a significance level \alpha = 0.05, Specimen PCB118(from Exercise 11.43) has a regression coefficient = 3.7611 and /P/-value = 0.000
+ Significance Test: 0.000 < 0.05 (Reject when P > \alpha)
+ /P/-value is much smaller than the significance level. Therefore, we don't reject the null hypothesis.
 
*** (d) Using the results in parts (b) and (c), write a short paragraph explaining how the inclusion of other variables in a multiple regression can have an effect on the estimate of a particular coefficient and the results of the associated significance test. 
As parts (b) and (c) of this exercise show, the statistical significance of another variable is changed entirely, just by removing one explanatory variable. In the case above, removing the explanatory variable PCB180 made another explanatory variable PCB118 no longer statistically significant, along with drastically changing the variables corresponding regression coefficient and P-value. 

** 11.46 Multiple regression model for total TEQ
*** (a) Consider using a multiple regression to predict TEQ using the tree components TEQPCB, TEQDIOXIN, and TEQFURAN as explanatory variables. Write the multiple regression model in the form: TEQ = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}TEQPCB + \beta_{2}TEQDIOXIN + \beta_{3}TEQFURAN + \epsilon. Give numerical values for the parameters \beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, and \beta_{3}.

\beta_{0} = 0, \beta_{1} = 1, \beta_{2} = 1, \beta_{3} = 1

TEQ = 0 + 1 * TEQPCB + 1 * TEQDIOXIN + 1 * TEQFURAN

*** (b) The multiple regression model assumes that the \epsilon's are Normal with mean zero and standard deviation \sigma. What is the numerical value of \sigma?
\sigma = s = 7.95e-6
*** (c) Use software to run this regression and summarize the results.

** 11.48 Predicting total amount of PCB using transformed variables
Because distributions of variables such as PCB, the PCB congeners, and TEQ tend to be skewed, researchers frequently analyze the logarithms of the measured variables. Create a data set that has the logs of each of the variables in the PCB data file. Note that zero is a possible value for PCB126; most software packages will eliminate these cases when you request a log transformation.

*** (a) If you do not do anything about the 16 zero values of PCB126, what does your software do with these cases? Is there an error message of some kind?
In the case of using the R language, the software will replace all the zero values with '-inf' without error.

*** (b) If you attempt to run a regression to predict the log of PCB using the log of PCB126 and the log of PCB52, are the cases with the zero values of PCB126 eliminated? Do you think that this is a good way to handle this situation?
In the case of the R language, the zero cases will remain and there will be no errors reported and it will perform the calculation, which can be beneficial. If there are zero's that are not intended, however, the software will not inform you. 

*** (c) The smallest nonzero value of PCB126 is 0.0052. One common practice when taking logarithms of measured values is to replace the zeros by one-half of the smallest observed value. Create a logarithm data set using this procedure; that is, replace the 16 zero values of PCB126 by 0.0026 before taking logarithms. Use numerical and graphical summaries to describe the distribution of the log variables.

** 11.49 Prediction total amount of PCB using transformed variables, continued. 
*** (a) Use numerical and graphical summaries to describe the relationships between each pair of log variables
[[./graphs/image10.png]]
[[./graphs/image9.png]]
All of the pairs shown in the above correlation table have a positive value for their correlation. There is one outlier in the pcb28, otherwise all charts are linearly correlated. 
*** (b) Compare these summaries with the summaries that you produced in Exercise 11.42 for the measured variables. 
All pairs are positively correlated. As the log values get higher the correlations appear to be higher.

The results of this mode: 
+ Multiple R^2 = 0.9751
+ Residual standard error SE = 0.135

The correlation coefficients for the data are also all positive. To say we have found the best fit, all assumptions made under the least squares regression should be upheld

[[./graphs/image11.png]]

Since these plots show approximately normal residuals, roughly linear relationships, independence and the assumptions are said to be upheld and the model is said to be a good fit.

The results of this model:

** 11.52 Interpretation of coefficients in log PCB regressions
Use the results of your analysis of the log PCB data in Exercise 11.50 to write an explanation of how regression coefficients, standard errors of regression coefficients, and tests of significance for explanatory variables can change depending on what other explanatory variables are included in the multiple regression analysis 

To summarize, the results tell us that the total amount of PCB is expected to either increase or decrease according to the coefficient of the respective congener. For example, log PCB180 has a correlation coefficient of 0.135 which means log PCB is expecrted to increase or decrease by 0.135 when log PCB180 increases or decreases by 1.

Significance Test:
+ H_0 : \beta_{1} = \beta_{2} = \beta_3 = \beta_4 = 0
+ H_a : one or more \beta \neq 0

The /P/-value of both PCB118 and constant are close to 0, but still significantly different.
Therefore, we reject null hypothesis and all the coefficients are significantly different from zero.

** 11.42 Relationships among PCB congeners 
Consider the following variables: PCB(the total amount of PCB) and four congeners: PCB52, PCB118, PCB138, and PCB180.
*** (a) Using numerical and graphical summaries, describe the distribution of each of these variables.

| PCB52    | 0.020 |   0.228 |  0.477 | 0.958 |   0.892 |  9.060 |
| PCB118   | 0.236 |   1.490 |  2.420 | 3.256 |   3.890 | 18.900 |
| PCB138   | 0.640 |   3.180 |  4.920 | 6.827 |   8.650 | 32.300 |
| PCB180   | 0.395 |   1.240 |  2.690 | 4.158 |   4.490 | 31.500 |

Figure 1 shows that the distribution of PCB and PCB180 is right skewed with about six outliers for both, while all the distribution of others are right skewed with about five outliers.  

*** (b) Using numerical and graphical summaries, describe the relationship between each pair of variables.

** 11.42 Relationships among PCB congeners 
Consider the following variables: PCB(the total amount of PCB) and four congeners: PCB52, PCB118, PCB138, and PCB180.
*** (a) Using numerical and graphical summaries, describe the distribution of each of these variables.

Figure 1 shows that the distribution of PCB and PCB180 is right skewed with about six outliers for both, while all the distribution of others are right skewed with about five outliers.  

*** (b) Using numerical and graphical summaries, describe the relationship between each pair of variables.

** 11.43 Predictiong the total amount of PCB
Use the four congeners PCB52, PCB118, PCB138, and PCB180 in a multiple regression to predict PCB. 
*** (a) Write the statistical model for this analysis. Include all assumptions.
The multiple linear regression model for the data with 69 observations:

y_i = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i1} + \beta_{2}x_{i2} + \beta_{3}x_{i3} + \beta_{4}x_{i4} + i /for/ /i = 1, 2, ... , 69/

We assume that the residuals are independent and are normally distributed. 
*** (b) Run the regression and summarize the results.
Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between PCB and four congeners. Running the multiple regression model in R with the four congeners produced the following:

#+END_EXAMPLE
We gathered the following from the results of the regression:
  + The multiple R^2 = 0.988
  + The residual SE = 6.249

*** (c) Examine the residuals. Do they appear to be approximately Normal? When you plot them versus each of the explanatory variables, are any patterns evident?
